**Client-side Rendering (CSR)** happens entirely on the browser after the initial HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are loaded. This means that after the page loads, the client fetches data via API calls and renders the content dynamically.

**Server-side Rendering (SSR)**, on the other hand, happens on the server. With SSR, the server renders the HTML on every request and sends it back to the browser, providing the content immediately.

### When to Use Client-side Rendering

Use **Client-side Rendering** when:

- You donâ€™t need the page to be indexed by search engines immediately
- The page content is personalized or user-specific (e.g., dashboards)
- Data can be fetched after the page loads, and you want faster initial load times

Use cases include:

- User profiles or settings pages
- Real-time data visualizations
- Interactive dashboards

### When to Use Server-side Rendering

Use **Server-side Rendering** when:

- SEO is important, and search engines need to crawl fully-rendered HTML
- The page needs to display data that is dynamic or based on the user's request
- You want to ensure that users get fully-rendered content on the first load

Examples of SSR use cases include:

- E-commerce product pages with dynamic pricing or stock availability
- News websites where content needs to be up-to-date for each request
