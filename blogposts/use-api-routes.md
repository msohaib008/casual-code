Next.js provides built-in support for creating API routes, allowing you to handle backend logic within the same codebase as your frontend. API routes can be created by adding JavaScript or TypeScript files to the `pages/api` directory.

You should use **API routes** when:

- You need to build serverless functions to handle requests without setting up a separate backend server
- You want to keep your API logic close to your frontend for small applications
- You need to fetch data, authenticate users, or handle form submissions

### Example Use Cases for API Routes:

- **Fetching external data**: You can use API routes to fetch external data and pass it to your components via `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`.
- **Handling authentication**: Use API routes to handle authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) for your Next.js app.
- **Sending form data**: When users submit forms, you can process and validate the data using API routes before saving it to a database.

### Limitations:

- API routes are best suited for small to medium-sized applications.
- For large-scale applications, consider using a dedicated backend or microservices.
